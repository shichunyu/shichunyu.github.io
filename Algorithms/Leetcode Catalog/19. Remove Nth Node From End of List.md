# [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/submissions/)

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:

```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.

```
**Note:**
Given n will always be valid.

**Follow up:**
Could you do this in one pass?
